# SolitaireSolver

I wrote a program to generate and solve random games of Klondike solitaire. It's not able to solve very many initial states, but there are a few that I've found so far that work. Like almost all the code I write, it's multithreaded to take advantage of as many cores as you have handy.

Open in VS2013, compile, and run.
